# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery helps in cost management, client satisfaction, risk management, resource efficiency
Project managers can achieve timely delivery by clear project planning, regular tracking, identify and mitigate risks, effective communication andsetting deadlines/scheduling
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
It contributes to its success through client satisfaction, financial stability, timely completion, risk mitigation
Some of the strategies are scope management, budgetting, risk management, using methodologies
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is itarative and incremental approach to project and software and its flexible such that you can add changes while waterfall methodology, each phase must becompleted before the next begins
Advantages of agile methodology are quick response, regular customer feedback, improved team collaboration
Disadvantages of agile are less predicability, requires significant customer involvement
Advantages of waterfall methodology are clear structure and documentation, easy to manage due to its rigidity
Disadvantages of waterfall are difficult to accomodate changes, testing occurs late in the process
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile might be beneficial in software startups & MVP Development
Startups often need to pivot based on user feedback. Agile allows frequent iterations and adjustments.
Example: A new food delivery app that needs continuous improvements based on real user data.
While on the other side waterfall can be beneficial in a Banking & Financial Software
High security, compliance, and structured development are needed.
Example: A core banking system upgrade, where every step must be tested before deployment.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Code Reviews & Pair Programming
Automated & Manual Testing
Security Testing
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Efficient Resource Allocation – Helps in planning budget, time, and workforce effectively
Risk Management – Identifies potential challenges early, allowing for mitigation strategies
Stakeholder Alignment – Ensures all stakeholders agree on what is being delivered
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Time management
Budget control
risk management
Perfomance tracking
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Time and Productivity Optimization-People often juggle multiple tasks and struggle with efficiency. My tools help streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and provide actionable solutions to save time
